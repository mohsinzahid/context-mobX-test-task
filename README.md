# context-mobX-test-task

it has two bottom tabs - Hooks and MobX.
In the Hooks tab, the app is developed using React Context API. In the MobX tab, it is developed using MobX.
In each tab, there is two input fields - lbs / kg, ft & inch / m. 
When Imperial is selected, it shows lbs and ft & inch. When Metric is selected, it shows as kg & m. When it's changing, values are automatically converting.
And it has a Save to disk button. When it's clicked, the data is stored in a file 
(it needs to be saved in the local file in the device). 
And when the app is opened, that file content is read, and stored data is shown.
